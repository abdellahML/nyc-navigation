### 1. Context

Name of the project: NYC safest path  
Context of the project: BeCode, Li√®ge Campus, AI/Data Operator Bootcamp, January 2021  
Objective of the project: Given two addresses (or coordinates) in New York city, find the least dangerous path between those two points.  
We used the cleaned dataset, `data_100000_out_final.csv` from the [NYC Crashes Project](../content/4.machine_learning/0.data_preprocessing/nyc_crashes_project.md).  
In this previous project we have applied all the first required steps to do a data preprocessing based [on collected informations about all the traffic accidents that happened in New York City.](https://github.com/becodeorg/LIE-Thomas-1.26/blob/master/content/additional_resources/datasets/NYC%20Motor%20Vehicle%20Crashes/data_100000.csv)


### 2. Description
In this project we create a Python script/application to find the safest path between the two given geographical locations in New York city.  
This algorithm find the least dangerous path and a graph of edges and vertices mapping to roads and intersections is given (Using OSMNX module).  
An interactive and more friendly web graphical interface has been created using HTML and HTTP request.
