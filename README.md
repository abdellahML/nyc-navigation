Name of the project: NYC safest path  
Context of the project: BeCode, Li√®ge Campus, AI/Data Operator Bootcamp, January 2021  
Objective of the project: Given two addresses (or coordinates) in New York city, find the least dangerous path between those two points.  
We used the cleaned dataset, `data_100000_out_final.csv` from the [NYC Crashes Project](../content/4.machine_learning/0.data_preprocessing/nyc_crashes_project.md).  
In this previous project we have applied all the first required steps to do a data preprocessing based [on collected informations about all the traffic accidents that happened in New York City.](https://github.com/becodeorg/LIE-Thomas-1.26/blob/master/content/additional_resources/datasets/NYC%20Motor%20Vehicle%20Crashes/data_100000.csv)


### 2. The mission
In this project we create a Python script/application to find the safest path the two given geographical localisation in New York city.
