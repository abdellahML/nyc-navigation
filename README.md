### 1. Context

Name of the project: NYC safest path  
Context of the project: BeCode, Li√®ge Campus, AI/Data Operator Bootcamp, January 2021  
Objective of the project: Given two addresses (or coordinates) in New York city, find the least dangerous path between those two points.  
We used the cleaned dataset, `data_100000_out_final.csv` from the [NYC Crashes Project](../content/4.machine_learning/0.data_preprocessing/nyc_crashes_project.md).  
In this previous project we have applied all the first required steps to do a data preprocessing based [on collected informations about all the traffic accidents that happened in New York City.](https://github.com/becodeorg/LIE-Thomas-1.26/blob/master/content/additional_resources/datasets/NYC%20Motor%20Vehicle%20Crashes/data_100000.csv)


### 2. Description
In this project we create a Python script/application to find the safest path between the two given geographical locations in New York city.  
The dangerosity has been defined as the potential number of accidents on a specific path based on the number of accidents occured each year on that specific path.  
This algorithm find the least dangerous path and a graph of edges and vertices mapping to roads and intersections is given (Using OSMNX module).  
An interactive and more friendly  graphical web interface has been created using HTML and HTTP request.  


## Usage

You can either enter your origin and destination locations in the `routes.py` and run the file or select directly your locations in the map on the interactive interface.  

An additional prepocessing phase has been created in the `preprocessing.py` file to addapt our data to the OSMNX data base.
